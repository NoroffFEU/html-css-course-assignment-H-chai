## Description

### Goal:

To put into practice everything Iâ€™ve learned about HTML and CSS over the course by bringing my design alive.

### Brief:

- The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted and valid.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars.
- The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
- Each page should have a unique <meta name="description">, <title>, and <h1>.
