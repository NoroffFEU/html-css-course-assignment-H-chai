## Description

This is a fictional website for my project.

### Goal:

To apply everything I've learned about HTML and CSS in the Front-end Development course at Noroff by bringing the design I created for the Design course assignment alive.

### Brief:

- The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted and valid.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars.
- Each page should have a unique 'meta name="description"', 'title', 'h1'.
- The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.

#### Client

An online shop selling men's and women’s rain jackets. They are designed for a range of different outdoor activities that enrich people's lives.

- Slogan: "Pushing the Comfort Zone"
- Target: Men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing
- Unique selling points: The jackets are mid-range in price and emphasize durability and being suitable for a range of different weather types ensuring customers are comfortable whatever adventure they go on.
